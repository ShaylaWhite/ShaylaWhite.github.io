Iâ€™ve finally completed my final project for Flatiron! 

Its a lot going on in the world currently so I wanted to build a app for mental check ins.

Gardens allows the user to update their rose gardens with roses. You can add roses the highlights or you day, thorns the lows of your day, and then water your garden/roses with how you can grow on your roses more for he next days to come.

The app was build with a Rails Api backend and A JS/React/Redux frontend.

I wont say it was a easy process but it was exciting. I never in a millon years thought I would complete Flatiron. But overall the rose petals and thorns I contuined to water myself to have a enough stregethn to keep going until I reached the finish line.
