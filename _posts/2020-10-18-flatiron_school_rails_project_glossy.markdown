In all honesty this project was hard for me. I started over several times, got sick and at times life was simply rough. 
However, I never gave up and Glossy was created. <br><br>
Glossy is a platform for young women to be empowered by becoming owners of their very own Lip Glosses. Glossy will teach the necessary skills of running a successful company, marketing, sales customer service, social media management, financial management, communication, negotiation, networking, project management and planning. <br><br>
I had a vision for the Glossy User to be able to keep track of their Lip Glosses by being able to add, update and delete Lip Glosses. In addition, the User can add reviews about their Lip Glosses and display the Sponsors of their Lip Glosses.  Glossy gives it Users a place to do trail and error of their Lip Glosses making sure their customers receive the best products possible.<br><br>
Implementing all the requirements for this Rails App was a great learning experience for me as a developer. The hardest requirements for me were:<br><br>
- [x] Include a class level ActiveRecord scope method 
- [x] Include third party signup/login (how e.g. Devise/OmniAuth)
- [x] Include nested resource show or index (URL e.g. users/2/recipes)
- [x] Include nested resource "new" form (URL e.g. recipes/1/ingredients/new)
- [x] Include form display of validation errors <br><br>

I enjoyed implementing the third-party SignUp/Login with OmniAuth. I choose to give the User the option to login with Google. I hate creating new passwords for every website and love when sites allow its users to Sign Up through a third-party site. Its rare to find someone without Google so I believed it was a great choice for the third-party option.

Giving the User the Google Login option was nice, also adding error messages throughout the Rails App was a great way to leave little helpers along the way to asssit the user along the way.  
<br>
<center> I love to make things easier for the User! </center>

<center> I also love when things are made easier for the developers. </center>
<br>
<br>
And Ruby really does a great job making things easier for developers with helper methods. The use of helper methods  makes code much easier to read, seperate, and make DRY. <br><br> I couldn't imagine trying to keep track of all these files without the Help of Ruby.  The most important takeaway for me from this Rails Project was how important   it is to follow the  separation of concerns  sticking to MVC, and using class methods .  We have to implement these features to keep our code clean and well-organized way, making the code much easier to understand as a developer.
<br>
<br>
Going forward I will expand the features of Glossy, I really think the idea of empowering young women through the use of technology is going to be very exciting.
