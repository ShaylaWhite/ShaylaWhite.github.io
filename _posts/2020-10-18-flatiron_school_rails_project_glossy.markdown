In all honesty this project was hard for me. I started over several times, got sick and at times life was simply rough. 
However, I never gave up and Glossy was created. 
Glossy is a platform for young women to be empowered by becoming owners of their very own Lip Glosses. Glossy will teach the necessary skills of running a successful company, marketing, sales customer service, social media management, financial management, communication, negotiation, networking, project management and planning.
