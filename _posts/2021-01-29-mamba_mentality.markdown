In honor of the late great Kobe Braynt, I just wanted to dive into what mamaba mentaliry and how useful it can be when applied to Coding and pretty much any aspect of life. 

*"To sum up what mamba mentality is, it means to be able to constantly try to be the best version of yourself," That is what the mentality is. It's a constant quest to try to better today than you were yesterday."

-Kobe Braynt

No matter how many times I wanted to cry stop or didnt think I could finish Flatiron I just kept coming back and back. This journey was not pretty or perfect but it was worth it.
