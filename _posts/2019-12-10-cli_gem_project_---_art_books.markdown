I completed my first project for Flatiron  and it was definitely an exciting experience and I learned a lot. I was able to review a lot of the curriculum which helped to aid in my understating of object orientation programing  and see how useful OOP is.

The goal of the project was to* "build a Ruby gem that provides a Command Line Interface (CLI) to an external data source."*
 

Simple and easy enough right?

 â€¦. But first you have to crawl before you can walk.
 
 My biggest problem was setting up the gem and work environment for this project. Just a word of advice save everything and make sure you are in the right directory always and save save save. If you choose to work online make sure your internet is reiable, becasue if not you are playing a dangerous game. I would advise anyone to just use a text editor and work offline. Everyone recommends Atom or Visual Studio Codeas as good text editors.
 
Once my  Ruby Gem 'good_reads'  was created and the pre populated directory and files  were added correctly. 
 the next step was  to add in my development dependencies ( colorize being my favorite btw) and also ensure my Github was updating in my Good_Reads repsisotory and not the learn Sandbox, which I had to learn the hardway. 
 But lesson learned!!!!
 
 With the Gem complated next step was the Creating the CLI. So the First thing I wanted to do was  understand the CLI process. 
 
*
The basic flow of a CLI app goes something like this:
1.	Greet the user.
2.	Ask the user for input.
3.	Capture and store that input.
4.	Do something with that input.*


With this in mind I had to choose what data I wanted to scrape and use for my CLI.

I choosed the site https://www.goodreads.com/genres/art . 

I wanted to give the user the newly released Artbooks list and go one level deep and let them select the Art Book that they wanted to learn more about and give them the link to do just that.

## HERE THE CLI IN ACTION!!!!!

 The three files I created to bring my Cli to life was the 
### Books.rb
### Cli.rb
### Scraper.rb

The Books.rb responaability is to store inaitialize and store all of the artbooks data from the scraper.rb file. The cli.rb file is where all of the magic happens. It accepts the user input and interacts with the user using the scrape data.




I had to review methods, classess and objects. But once I understood everything in Ruby is a object i gets a lote easier to process.

Overall great learning experince. But getting the flu this process really sucked.
