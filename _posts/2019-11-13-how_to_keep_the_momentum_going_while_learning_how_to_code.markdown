When I started Flatiron School earlier this year I envision in my mind exactly how this journey would take place and exactly how long it would take me to complete it. I was eager and excited. You know that first day of school feeling or the Christmas Eve night feeling filled with jitters of excitement.
Yes that was me so young, naive and ready to take on this coding world. **  But ….......................................................................... **

# BOOM!
#### Yup, this gif says it all. The universe DEFINITELY  had other plans than I envisioned.  
**However it’s not how many times you get knocked down but how many time you can get back up.
**For the true essence of a **code heart-ed** individual is someone who can overcome time and time again and always get back up. 

No matter how long it takes them! So here I am after being knocked out by life and by code a few times this year, STILL STANDING. 

The only difference now is that I have built up the mental toughness to handle all of the knock downs and keep the momentum going on my journey to learn how to code. So I thought it would be cool to offer a few tips to the next person on how to maintain that momentum when learning how to code. 

### Always remember that everyone was once a novice at something. 

At one point Lebron James wasn’t Lebron James, Beyonce wasn’t Beyonce and Jay Z wasn’t Jay Z. My point is we all have to start somewhere, so don’t get down on yourself for not knowing or understanding coding concepts. It will come in time. Just keep at it.


### Practice Self Care
Learning to code is hard and mentally testing. You have to continually nurture yourself. Exercise, eat right, mediate, set a schedule, and listen to your body.
 Somedays maybe all you can manage is coding for 25 mins and others 4 hours. But don’t beat yourself up just focus on getting better than you were the day before.  
**While coding for long time periods, take quick 5,10,15 or 30 minute breaks to keep yourself fresh. It really helps with your productivity. 

### Be Disciplined  Consistent & Patience 
You have to show up every day for yourself. It basically boils down to how bad you want it. Are you willing to miss out on fun and activities to get where you need to be? Less time on social media, miss your favorite TV shows? Miss date nights? 
No matter how hard of a take you are facing if you are willing to go hard as hell eventually you will master it. This is where patience comes into play. Often on this journey fear and doubt will definitely rear their ugly faces but don’t believe them. You can do this, just keep coding. Yes you’re going to have your ups and downs but never give up.

Never forget. Its's a marathon.
